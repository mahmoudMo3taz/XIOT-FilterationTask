## acomplishment
* arduino function to control one input and output (IO Pins) the input pin is a switch as interrupt * * once it pressed it should lighting the led connected to output pin
* program can send continuous serial date comes from temperature sensor with 3 second rate .at the same time
* if the switch pressed must send “pressed” to the serial monitor only one time also send the LED states ”ON” or “OFF”
## Experiance with arduino
*very good
